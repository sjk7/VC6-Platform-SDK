*
*Purpose:
*       The routine "_putch()" writes a single character to the console.
*
*       NOTE: In real-mode MS-DOS the character is actually written to standard
*       output, and is therefore redirected when standard output is redirected.
*       However, under Win32 console mode, the character is ALWAYS written
*       to the console, even when standard output has been redirected.
