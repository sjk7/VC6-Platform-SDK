*_PBLKDESC _heap_search(unsigned size) - Find a free block of a least size
*       bytes.
*
*Purpose:
*       Finds a free block of at least size bytes. Searches the list of block
*       descriptors from *proverdesc to the end (marked by the sentinel). The
*       search is strictly first fit. Adjacent free blocks are coalesced as
*       they are encountered during the search.
*
*Entry:
*       unsigned size   - size of block requested
*
*Exit:
*       Success:  Pointer to descriptor for free memory block of at least size
*               bytes
*       Failure:  NULL
*
*Uses:
*
*Exceptions:
