*int _heapadd(block, size) - Add a block of memory to the heap
*
*Purpose:
*       Add a block of user memory the heap.
*
*       NOTE:  The reason for the level of indirection between _heapadd
*       and _heap_addblock is (1) to validate the input, and (2) for
*       mthread locking/unlocking purposes.
*
*       NOTE: _heapadd() DOES NOT enter the block of memory into the region
*       table! This is the cleanest way to avoid nasty bugs such as attempting
*       to grow, shrink or free static memory (e.g., a block that started out
*       being a static array). If the memory block does in fact belong in the
*       region table, it is the caller's responsibility to do it (internal
*       routines only, user programs should NEVER do this).
*
*Entry:
*       void * block = block of memory
*       size_t size = size of memory block

*Exit:
*        0 = success
*       -1 = failure
