The \Mssdk\Samples\SysMgmt directory contains samples for the following 
Platform SDK components:

* Microsoft Management Console (MMC)
* Task Scheduler
* Windows 95 Migration DLLs for Windows 2000 setup
* Microsoft System Management Server
* Setup and Microsoft Installer Service
* Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)
 

The build environment (headers, libraries, and minimum build
tools) for the Platform SDK must be installed in order to build
any of the samples in the \Mssdk\Samples directory. The build
environment can be installed from the readme.htm or by running
setup.exe on the root of the Platform SDK compact disc. The most
recent version of the build environment is also available at
http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate.

Some components may also require you to install runtimes, depending
on the platform on which you are trying to run the sample.
Redistributables are available in the \Mssdk\Redist subdirectory
on the Platform SDK compact disc.

Documentation for the components listed above can be installed
from the Platform SDK compact disc, or can be viewed online at
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/. This is a free service.

If you do not see any subdirectories in the \Mssdk\Samples\SysMgmt 
node, you'll need to install the Setup and Systems Management components 
from the Platform SDK compact disc or download and install them
from http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate.
