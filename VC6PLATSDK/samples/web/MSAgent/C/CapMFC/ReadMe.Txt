Microsoft Character Animation Previewer Sample
----------------------------------------------

This sample demonstrates the use of the Microsoft Agent control from an
MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes) application. It allows you to preview
Microsoft Agent character animations. The Agent control wrapper classes
were automatically generated by the MFC class wizard and reside in the
files ac*.h and ac*.cpp.

The file MainDlg.cpp is the core of the application.
