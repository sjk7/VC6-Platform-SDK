Hello World 3 (C++) Sample for Microsoft Agent
----------------------------------------------

*** Required components ***

1. This sample requires the Microsoft Agent include files.  These files
along with the addition *_i.c files should be copied to the Visual C++

from the %windows%\msagent\chars directory. If they can't be
found in that directory, it attempts to load them from the
%program files%\Microsoft Agent\Characters directory.
