<!-- Updated to use Version 2.0 -->

<HR width=66%>
<P>This page illustrates the most basic use of Microsoft Agent.
<BR>Once the character and its animations have been successfully
<BR>loaded, Robby will appear, say hello, and disappear.
<BR>You can refresh the page to make this happen again.
<P>Be patient!  Loading of the character may take a few minutes.
<P>This sample loads its character from an HTTP URL,
<BR>so you must be connected to the WWW and be able to
<BR>reach the server at <I>http://agent.microsoft.com</I>,
<BR>or the sample will not work properly.
<P>If you have never installed the Lernout & Hauspie TTS Engine,
<BR>you will be prompted to install it.  Without the TTS Engine,
<BR>characters will speak, but will not produce audible speech output.
<P>Right-click on the page and select <B>View Source</B>
<BR>to examine the HTML code for this page.

<!--
In order to use Microsoft Agent, the Microsoft Agent Control
OBJECT tag must be placed on the page.  The presence of this
tag will cause the control to be automatically downloaded and
installed if it is not found on the client machine when the
page is processed.  In the example below, the CODEBASE
attribute is used so that the latest version number can be
specified.  The Agent object will be referred to in script using
the name assigned to it in the ID field of the OBJECT tag -
in this case, "AgentControl".

In order to use Text-to-Speech (TTS) output, a TTS engine compatible
with Microsoft Agent must be installed on the client's machine.
Your Microsoft Agent license includes a license to use the TruVoice
TTS engine from Lernout & Hauspie with Microsoft Agent.  The OBJECT tag
below causes the TTS engine to be downloaded and installed if it is
not found on the client machine when the page is processed. The
CODEBASE atribute is included in order to specify the latest version
number of the control.

' In this example the Microsoft Agent control is managed using VBScript.
' Alternatively, JScript could be used.

Dim Robby	' a global variable to hold the character object

' Necessary initialization of the control and charcter are most
' readily accomplished in a page's OnLoad procedure, which is
' run automatically when the page is first loaded in a browser.
' The character to be used must first be loaded into the control.
' In this example the character is loaded from an HTTP URL, which
' must point to a .ACF file, and an object reference to the newly
' loaded character is saved in the global variable Robby.
' Once a character has been loaded from a .ACF
' file, it is necessary to GET each animation before PLAYing it.
' Here we GET all the animations that will be needed at once,
' rather than waiting until just before they are played.
' Newly loaded characters are initially hidden, so we show the
' character as the last step in initializing the character.  Since
' all the requests to the Agent control are queued and executed
' in request order, the appearance of the character will indicate
' that the preceding requests succeeded.  Note that this sample does
' not include any code to handle request failures.  A production
' quality page should always include error handling.
