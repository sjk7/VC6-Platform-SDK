OVERVIEW OF THE HTML SAMPLE
===========================

The HTML directory contains two sample HTML Web pages that are the same 
except one shows the user of the ActiveX Control from VBScript, and the 
other shows the use of the ActiveX Control from JScript. These samples 
illustrate the key Web-related functionality enabled by the Control, 
which is using a Web page to bring together, in a conference, a 
community of users with a similar interest.


USING THE HTML SAMPLE
=====================

To use the HTML sample, replace the machine name "ConfHost" in the HTML 
with the name of the machine on which you want to host the conference. 
The location in which to do this is clearly marked with a comment in 
the .htm file.

Notes: 

1. You must have Windows NetMeeting 3 installed in order to run this 
   example.

2. This example works only with Internet Explorer version 4.01 and later.
