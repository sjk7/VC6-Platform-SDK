OVERVIEW OF THE NMSHARE SAMPLE
==============================

NMSHARE is a Windows utility application that allows the user to 
share application windows via an existing NetMeeting connection.  


BUILDING THE NMSHARE SAMPLE
========================

Building the sample application requires VC++ Version 6.0 or later.

To build the sample from Visual C++, open the project makefile (nmshare.mak) 
as a Microsoft VC++ project, and build as usual.  The NetMeeting SDK 
directories must be added to your VC++ environment.

If your DOS environment is correctly configured, you can build the sample
from the command line by typing "nmake".  The DOS path, include and lib
environment variables must point to the VC installation and the 
NetMeeting SDK directories.
