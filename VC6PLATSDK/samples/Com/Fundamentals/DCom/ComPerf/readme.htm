<h2>COM Performance Sample</h2>
<hr>
<p><b>PURPOSE</b>: This is the reference performance sample for COM/DCOM run on
local and remote machines. This program is both a client and a server. It
launches as a client by default, registering its executable as a server with COM
and creating other instances of itself on a remote and local machine to be
servers. A single command-line argument is allowed for a remote server name.
Performance numbers in calls/sec are output in tabular form. Tests COM and
IDispatch method calls with two security levels: default/min and full. Use
DCOMCNFG to set default security to Authn Lvl to NONE for best comparison.
Parameter sizes are varied to see effect on security levels(~4/50/4k bytes).
Uses psperf.dll MIDL generated proxy/stub implementation. Put psperf.dll in same
dir as this exe on all machines. Run exe on each machine to automatically
register class code and proxy/stub dll. You can then run on either machine and
pass a remote machine name (DNS or IP address) as single cmd-line parameter.</p>
<p>Instructions: Install on one or more machines as described above. Run on
command- line as &quot;comperf&quot;. A single command-line argument is allowed
for a remote server name. E.g. &quot;comperf MyComputer&quot; or &quot;comperf
123.44.44.234&quot; using IP address. This sample may be compiled as UNICODE or
ANSI</p>
<p>Usage: COMPERF [machine name | IP address | /? | -?] Where: /? Displays help
screen machine name Name of remote machine IP address IP address of remote
machine</p>

<p><b>NOTE</b>: When building this sample for 64-bit platforms, the MDAC SDK 
must also be installed.&nbsp; The 64-bit version of the sample has a dependency 
on the 64-bit version of odbd32.lib, which ships as part of the MDAC SDK.</p>
