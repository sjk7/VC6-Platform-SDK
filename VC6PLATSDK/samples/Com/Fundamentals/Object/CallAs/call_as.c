    COMMENTS:   This version of the Ole2 distributed application that
                prints "hello, world" (or other string) on the server
                features a non-rpcable custom interface being remoted with
                [call_as].

// this file provides the conversion routines between the remoted
// interface and the local view of the interface.  This allows an interface
// with apparently non-remotable methods to be remoted.  The conversions
// may be similar to transmit_as or represent_as conversions, or they
// can be more dramatic, such as synthesizing additional parameters, etc.
// in this case, the return type is changed


// The IHelloCallAs_HelloProc_Proxy routine goes into the vtable for
// the clients IHelloCallAs objects, so the client calls this first
// when they invoke the HelloProc method on an IHelloCallAs object.

// The IHelloCallAs_HelloProc_Stub routine is called by the server
// side stub when the remoted call comes in.  It does any conversions
// needed and then invokes the real HelloProc method on the servers
// IHelloCallAs object implementation.

// both of these must be provided in the proxy DLL, because the
// SAME proxy dll is used for both the client and server sides.




// this routine goes into the client side "proxy" object for the server.
// it has the parameter list of the non-remoted (local) flavor of the
// call, and converts it to the remoted flavor of the call.  It can also
// do special case memory management, have debugging hooks, etc.
