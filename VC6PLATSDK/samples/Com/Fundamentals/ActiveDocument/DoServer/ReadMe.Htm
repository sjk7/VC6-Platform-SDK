<h2>ActiveX Document Server Sample &quot;DOServer&quot;</h2>
<hr>
<p>DOServer is a very simple example of an ActiveX Document server. It
implements the minimum number of interfaces required to have an object be an
ActiveX Document.</p>
<p>If the application is executed without the &quot;/embedding&quot; switch, a
dialog box will be displayed that has options for registering the server and
creating a working file. When Register Server is selected, the application will
make all of the required entries into the registry to register the application
as an ActiveX Document server. This must be done at least once before attempting
to load a working file into a container.</p>
<p>If the Create File option is selected, the user can create a new file that
can be loaded into an ActiveX Document container (such as Internet Explorer,
Microsoft Office Binder or the Framer sample in this SDK).</p>
<p>This ActiveX Document only implements a color feature. Once the file is
loaded into the container, the color can be selected from the Color menu that
the server adds to the container's menu.</p>
