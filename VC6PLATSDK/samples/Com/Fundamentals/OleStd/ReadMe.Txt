OLE Standard Utility Library


The OLESTD sample creates a library of utility functions which you may find
helpful to use as a model for writing your own code.

Most of this code was once part of the OLE2UI sample library that used to
be included in the OLE samples. Since OLEDLG.DLL was added to the set of
system-supported OLE libraries, much of the old OLE2UI code has become
obsolete. This library contains most of the remaining functionality from
that DLL.

THIS LIBRARY IS NOT AN OFFICIAL PART OF THE OLE SPECIFICATION. It is 
intended only to demonstrate techniques and methods; it is not intended to 
be used as a professional development library. Microsoft cannot guarantee 
that all of this code is completely correct or fully operational.

You may feel free to incorporate some of this code in your applications but
please be aware that it has undergone limited testing and may not be 
entirely free of bugs.
