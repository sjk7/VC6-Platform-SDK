
APTCLIEN - Client of an apartment model out-of-process local server


SUMMARY
=======

The APTCLIEN sample shows a client of several single-threaded apartments
in the APTSERVE server. APTCLIEN's main purpose is to exercise and reveal
for study the multiple apartments in the APTSERVE local out-of-process
server. The following REMCLIEN sample, run in conjunction with APTCLIEN,
shows the effects of multiple clients on the APTSERVE multithreaded
server, with one client controlling from a remote machine.

The COM objects that APTCLIEN manipulates are the car-related ones from
previous samples in this tutorial series, with the following interfaces:
ICar, IUtility, and ICruise. APTCLIEN works in conjunction with the
separate APTSERVE.EXE, which provides the COCar, COUtilityCar, and
COCruiseCar COM objects.

APTCLIEN.EXE creates its own COUtilityCruiseCar COM object by reusing the
COCruiseCar COM object by containment and augmenting it with a native
implementation of the IUtility interface. Like LOCCLIEN, APTCLIEN's
COUtilityCruiseCar composite object reuses COCruiseCar by containment.
However, because COCruiseCar and COCar are in different apartments,
COCruiseCar reuses COCar by containment rather than the aggregation shown
in previous lessons.

The composition of COUtilityCruiseCar is also interesting because the
COUtilityCruiseCar object's containment of the COCruiseCar object crosses
the process boundary between APTCLIEN and the out-of-process local server
APTSERVE.EXE. In addition, COCruiseCar's containment of COCar crosses
thread boundaries within APTSERVE. APTCLIEN uses standard marshaling
support for the custom interfaces it uses on the COCruiseCar and COCar
objects. This marshaling support is provided by the previous MARSHAL
code sample, so you must build the MARSHAL code sample prior to building
and running APTCLIEN and APTSERVE.

For functional descriptions and a tutorial code tour of APTCLIEN, see the
Code Tour section in APTCLIEN.HTM. For details on the external user
operation of APTCLIEN, see both the Usage and Operation sections in
APTCLIEN.HTM. To read APTCLIEN.HTM, run TUTORIAL.EXE in the main tutorial
directory and click the APTCLIEN lesson in the table of lessons. You can
also achieve the same thing by clicking the APTCLIEN.HTM file after
locating the main tutorial directory in the Windows Explorer. See also
APTSERVE.HTM in the main directory for more details on how APTSERVE works
and exposes its services to APTCLIEN. You must build APTSERVE.EXE before
building APTCLIEN. The makefile for APTSERVE automatically registers that
server in the registry, so you must build APTSERVE before attempting to
run APTCLIEN.

For details on setting up your system to build and test the code samples
in this COM Tutorial series, see TUTORIAL.HTM. The supplied MAKEFILE is
Microsoft NMAKE-compatible. To create a debug build, issue the NMAKE
command in the Command Prompt window.

For convenient use in Microsoft's Visual Studio, a project file is
provided for each sample. To load the project for the APTCLIEN sample,
you can run Visual Studio at the Command Prompt in the sample's directory
as follows:

    MSDEV APTCLIEN.DSP

You can also simply double-click the .DSP file in the Windows Explorer to
load a sample's project into Visual Studio. From within Visual
Studio you can then browse the C++ classes of the sample source and
generally perform the other edit-compile-debug operations. Note that, as
part of the Platform SDK, the compilation of these samples from within
Visual Studio requires the proper setting of directory paths in
Visual Studio. For more details, see the Building the Code Samples
section in USING.HTM.

Usage
-----

APTCLIEN is an application that you can execute directly from Windows in
the normal manner or from the Command Prompt window. No command line
parameters are recognized by APTCLIEN.
