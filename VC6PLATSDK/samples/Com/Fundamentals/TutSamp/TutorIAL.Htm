<h2>Overview: COM Tutorial Programming Samples</h2>

<P>
October 22, 1998

<P>
This tutorial sample series is directed to serve advanced programmers who
are using their proficiency in C++ Win32 programming to develop or modify
systems-level software using COM (Component Object Model) technology.
These advanced samples show how to program components at the foundation
level of COM. Neither MFC nor ATL is used in the samples.

<P>
If you are developing internet Web applications with ActiveX controls and
an integrated development environment like Microsoft Visual Studio,
then you have the benefit of tools and abstractions that hide most of the
technical detail covered in this series. The series exposes much of the
infastructure that is now being increasingly hidden by MFC (Microsoft
Foundation Classes) and ATL (Active Template Library). This series can
help when you need to drop below the convenient abstractions in MFC or ATL
to perform COM-compliant modifications. Of course, it can also help if you
are working directly at this foundation level of COM programming to
develop the highest performance professional applications.

<P>
These source code samples are the same as those currently found as branch
\MSSDK\SAMPLES\COM\TUTSAMP of the installed Microsoft Platform SDK.

<P>
The samples branch consists of directories organized in a graduated
sequence of tutorial lessons. The numbered order of lessons is the
sequence we recommend that you follow in the tutorial. Each lesson
illustrates a major feature of COM technology. Most lessons build on the
ones that came earlier in the sequence.

<P>
Each code sample has an associated description of the sample's external
operation and a narrative code tour of the internal construction (based on
the specific goal of the tutorial lesson). This tutorial narrative resides
in a [lesson].HTM Web page file--where [lesson] is the name of the
lesson/code sample. There is one of these narrative HTML files for each
tutorial code sample. All of these HTML files are located in the main
directory of the tutorial samples branch. The complete tutorial is thus
made up of many HTML files located in the parent directory of all the
sample directories. This single parent directory is the main tutorial
directory. Additional details on the internal mechanisms of each sample
can be found in code comments in each source file located in the sample's
directory.

<P>
The tutorial HTML files for the tutorial samples are linked together into
a Web that can be viewed with a Web browser. The tutorial is aimed at
revealing how to program the major features of COM and the internal
behavior of the sample components. While this can serve as an inductive
means to appreciate COM architectural theory, this tutorial complements
other more comprehensive works that cover the full conceptual breadth of
COM, ActiveX, and OLE technology. Some recommended works are:

<ul>
<li>The <i>ActiveX and Object Services</i> branch of the online
    documentation for the Platform SDK</li>

<li><i>The Component Object Model Specification</i> (see Microsoft's
       Web site at: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/com/"
                       target="_self">
                       http://www.microsoft.com/com/</a>)</li>

<li><i>Inside OLE</i> 2nd Edition by Kraig Brockschmidt
       (Microsoft Press)</li>

<li><i>Understanding ActiveX and OLE</i> by David Chappell
       (Microsoft Press)</li>

<li><i>Inside COM</i> by Dale Rogerson (Microsoft Press)</li>

<li><i>Inside Distributed COM</i> by Guy Eddon and Henry Eddon
       (Microsoft Press)</li>

<li><i>Essential COM</i> by Don Box (Addison Wesley)</li>

<li><i>Professional DCOM Programming</i> by Dr. Richard Grimes
       (Wrox Press)</li>
</ul>

<P>
After installing the complete sample set, you can start browsing this
tutorial by executing the TUTORIAL.EXE command in the main tutorial
directory. You must have a Web browser installed for TUTORIAL.EXE to work.
The Web browser must have a file association with the .HTM file extension.
If you are reading this Web page on the World Wide Web then you can
download the complete sample set to obtain the source code for the samples
that accompany the tutorial as well as copies of the Web pages that
comprise the tutorial.
