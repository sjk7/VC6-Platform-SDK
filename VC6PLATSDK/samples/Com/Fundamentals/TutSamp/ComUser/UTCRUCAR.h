  Summary:   Include file for the aggregatable COUtilityCruiseCar COM
             object class.

             UTCRUCAR showcases the construction of the COUtilityCruiseCar
             COM object class with the IUnknown, ICar, ICruise, and IUtility
             interfaces.  This is done through Aggregation reuse of a
             COCruiseCar COM object (specifically providing its ICar and
             ICruise interface features).  COUtilityCruiseCar adds its own
             native implementation of the IUtility interface.  The
             aggregated CruiseCar object is implemented and provided in
             an outside COMOBJ.DLL.

             This multiple interface COM Object Class is achieved via
             the technique of nested classes: the implementation of the
             IUtility interface is nested inside of the COUtilityCruiseCar
             COM object class.

             contents and offerings see the tutorial COMUSER.HTM
             file.  For more specific technical details on the internal
             workings see the comments dispersed throughout the
             module's source code.

  ObjectClass: COUtilityCruiseCar

  Summary:     COM Object Class for COUtilityCruiseCar COM Objects.
               COM objects of this class augment COCruiseCar COM objects
               with the IUtility interface features of Offroad and Winch.
               COCruiseCar is reused to offer this COUtilityCruiseCar COM
               Object the ICar interface features of Shift, Clutch, Speed,
               Steer and the ICruise interface features of Engage and
               Adjust.  This COUtilityCruiseCar COM object class is
               constructed by aggregation reuse of the COCruiseCar COM
               object class.  The mulitple interfaces on this COM object
               class are constructed via the nested class
               interfaces technique.

  Interfaces:  IUnknown
                 Standard interface providing COM object features.
               ICar
                 Basic car features.
               ICruise
                 Cruise control system features.
               IUtility
                 Sport-utility Car operation features.  Implemented in
                 this COM object.

  Aggregation: Yes, COUtilityCruiseCar COM objects are aggregatable by
               passing a non-NULL pUnkOuter IUnknown pointer into
               the constructor.
