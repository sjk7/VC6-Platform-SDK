  File:      DLLSKEL.H

  Summary:   Include file for the DLLSKEL.DLL dynamic link library.  This
             include file is meant to serve double duty as providing
             general set of macros that (1) when included in a DLLSKEL
             implementation file wherein it provides a DLLENTRY
             designation for the definition of exported functions and (2)
             when included in an app that uses these function calls it
             provides a DLLENTRY designation for the declaration of
             imported functions.  The default behavior is to serve
             consumer apps that import the functions in the providing
             DLLSKEL.DLL.  Prior to the #include of this DLLSKEL.H if
             _DLLEXPORT_ is #defined, the bahavior is to serve the DLLSKEL
             itself in defining the functions as exported.

             For a comprehensive tutorial code tour of DLLSKEL's contents
             and offerings see the tutorial DLLSKEL.HTM file. For more
             specific technical details on the internal workings see the
             comments dispersed throughout the DLLSKEL source code.
