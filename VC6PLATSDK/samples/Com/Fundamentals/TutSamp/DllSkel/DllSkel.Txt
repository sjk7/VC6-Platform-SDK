
DLLSKEL - Win32 DLL Skeleton


SUMMARY
=======

The DLLSKEL sample introduces the basic DLL skeleton that can be used as a
point of departure for more complex Win32 DLLs (dynamic link libraries).
It is used as a base for other COM Tutorial code samples. In this series
of COM Tutorial code samples, DLLSKEL works with the DLLUSER code sample
to illustrate how DLLSKEL's function services are called by an EXE
consumer.

For functional descriptions and a tutorial code tour of DLLSKEL, see the
Code Tour section in DLLSKEL.HTM. For details on setting up the
programmatic usage of DLLSKEL, see the Usage section in DLLSKEL.HTM. To
read DLLSKEL.HTM, run TUTORIAL.EXE in the main tutorial directory and
click the DLLSKEL lesson in the table of lessons. You can also achieve the
same thing by clicking the DLLSKEL.HTM file after locating the main
tutorial directory in the Windows Explorer. See also DLLUSER.HTM in the
main tutorial directory for more details on the DLLUSER application and
how it works with DLLSKEL.DLL. You must build DLLSKEL.DLL before building
DLLUSER. After producing DLLSKEL.DLL and DLLUSER.EXE, the makefile for
DLLSKEL copies the necessary DLLSKEL.H, DLLSKEL.LIB, and DLLSKEL.DLL files
to the appropriate sibling directories.

In general, to set up your system to build and test the code samples in
this COM Tutorial series, see TUTORIAL.HTM for details. The supplied
makefile (MAKEFILE) is Microsoft NMAKE-compatible. To create a debug
build, issue the NMAKE command at the command prompt.

For convenient use in Microsoft's Visual Studio, a project file is
provided for each sample. To load the project for the DLLSKEL sample,
you can run Visual Studio at the Command Prompt in the sample's directory
as follows:

    MSDEV DLLSKEL.DSP

You can also simply double-click the .DSP file in the Windows Explorer to
load a sample's project into Visual Studio. From within Visual
Studio you can then browse the C++ classes of the sample source and
generally perform the other edit-compile-debug operations. Note that, as
part of the Platform SDK, the compilation of these samples from within
Visual Studio requires the proper setting of directory paths in
Visual Studio. For more details, see the Building the Code Samples
section in USING.HTM.

Usage
-----

DLLSKEL is a DLL that you can access from applications by either
performing an explicit LoadLibrary call or implicitly loading the DLL by
linking to its associated .LIB file. In either case, you need to include
DLLSKEL.H to declare the functions that are defined as exported in the
DLLSKEL DLL. In the case of this Tutorial lesson, a representative
DLLUSER.EXE application is provided to illustrate the programmatic use of
DLLSKEL.DLL. DLLUSER is built in the DLLUSER lesson (in sibling directory
DLLUSER). See below for more details.


FILES

Files        Description

DLLSKEL.TXT  This file.
MAKEFILE     The generic makefile for building the DLLSKEL.DLL
             code sample of this tutorial lesson.
DLLSKEL.H    The include file for declaring as imported or defining as
             exported the service functions in DLLSKEL.DLL. Meant for
             eventual use by outside users of the DLL.
DLLSKEL.CPP  The main implementation file for DLLSKEL.DLL. Has DllMain
             and the two exported service functions.
DLLSKELI.H   The include file for the internal class declarations and
             the identifier definitions for resources stored inside the
             DLLSKEL.DLL.
DLLSKEL.RC   The DLL resource definition file.
DLLSKEL.ICO  The icon resource.
