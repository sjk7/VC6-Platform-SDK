  File:      DLLSKEL.CPP

  Summary:   Implementation file for the general DLL skeleton
             that can be used as a point of departure for more complex
             COM Win32 DLLs.  It is used as a skeletal base for
             the COM Tutorial series of code samples.

             DLLSKEL.CPP contains the DllMain entry function for the DLL.
             As a simple skeleton, this DLL contains only two
             representative exported function calls: DllHelloBox and
             DllAboutBox.

             For a comprehensive tutorial code tour of DLLSKEL's
             contents and offerings see the tutorial DLLSKEL.HTM file.
             For more specific technical details on the internal workings
             see the comments dispersed throughout the DLLSKEL source code.

  Classes:   none.

  Functions: DllMain, DllHelloBox, DllAboutBox

  Origin:    12-9-96: atrent - Created and revised via editor-inheritance
               of DLLSKEL.C in the Win32 SDK FRMWORK code samples.

  We include OLE2.H because we will be calling the COM/OLE Libraries
    in future exploitation of this DLL skeleton.
  We include APPUTIL.H because we will be building this DLL using
    the convenient Virtual Window and Dialog classes and other
    utility functions in the APPUTIL Library (ie, APPUTIL.LIB).
  We include DLLSKELI.H because it has internal class declarations and
    resource ID definitions specific for this DLL.
  We include DLLSKEL.H because it has the necessary STDENTRY function
    prototypes.  The _DLLEXPORT_ #define is used to tell DLLSKEL.H to
    define the appropriate functions as exported from this DLL.
    Otherwise, DLLSKEL.H is included by users of this DLL who do not
    define _DLLEXPORT_ so that the appropriate functions are then
    declared as imports rather than defined as exports.

  Function: DllMain

  Summary:  Like WinMain is for an EXE application, this DllMain function
            is the main entry point for this DLL.  It is called when the
            DLL is loaded by a process, and when new threads are created
            by a process that has already loaded this DLL.  DllMain is also
            called when threads of a process that has loaded the DLL exit
            cleanly and when the process itself unloads the DLL.

            If you want to use C runtime libraries, keep this function
            named "DllMain" and you won't have to do anything special to
            initialize the runtime libraries.

            When fdwReason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH, the return value is used
            to determine if the DLL should remain loaded, or should be
            immediately unloaded depending upon whether the DLL could be
            initialized properly.  For all other values of fdwReason,
            the return value is ignored.

  Args:     HINSTANCE hDllInst,
              Instance handle of the DLL.
            DWORD fdwReason,
              Process attach/detach or thread attach/detach.
              Reason for calling.
            LPVOID lpvReserved)
              Reserved and not used.

  Returns:  BOOL,
              Return value is used only when fdwReason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH.
              TRUE  -  Used to signify that the DLL should remain loaded.
              FALSE -  Used to signify that the DLL should be
                immediately unloaded.
