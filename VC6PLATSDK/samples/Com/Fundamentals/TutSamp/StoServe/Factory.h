  Summary:   Include file for the class factory COM object: CFPaper. This
             constitutes the STOSERVE server's class factory for the
             DllPaper COM component.

             The multiple interface COM Object Class is achieved via the
             technique of nested classes: the implementation of the
             standard IClassFactory interface is nested inside of the
             class factory COM object class. APPUTIL's CThreaded OwnThis
             mechanism is used to ensure mutually exclusive access to the
             class factory by contending multiple threads.

             For a comprehensive tutorial code tour of this module's
             contents and offerings see the tutorial STOSERVE.HTM
             file. For more specific technical details on the internal
             workings see the comments dispersed throughout the module's
             source code.

  ObjectClass: CFPaper

  Summary:     Class Factory COM Object Class for DllPaper COM components.
               Used to manufacture COPaper COM objects.  The mulitple
               interfaces on this COM object class are constructed via the
               nested interface classes technique.

  Interfaces:  IUnknown
                 Standard interface providing COM object features.
               IClassFactory
                 Standard interface providing COM Class Factory features.

  Aggregation: Yes, CFPaper COM objects are aggregatable by
               passing a non-NULL pUnkOuter IUnknown pointer into the
               constructor.
