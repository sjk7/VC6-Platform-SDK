
DLLCLIEN - Client of DLL Server


SUMMARY
=======

The DLLCLIEN sample presents a series of COM objects, several of which were
introduced in the DLLSERVE code sample. These objects represent various
types of cars, and they expose the following interfaces: ICar, IUtility,
and ICruise. DLLCLIEN works in conjunction with the separate DLLSERVE.DLL,
which creates COCar, COUtilityCar, and COCruiseCar COM objects.

DLLCLIEN.EXE creates its own COUtilityCruiseCar COM object, which is
constructed by reusing the COCruiseCar COM object by aggregation and
augmenting it with the IUtility interface. Because the COCruiseCar COM
object class is also an aggregate--that is, it reuses an inner COCar
object by aggregation--DLLCLIEN illustrates nested aggregation of COM
objects.

For functional descriptions and a tutorial code tour of DLLCLIEN, see the
Code Tour section in DLLCLIEN.HTM. For details on the external user
operation of DLLCLIEN, see both the Usage and Operation sections in
DLLCLIEN.HTM. To read DLLCLIEN.HTM, run TUTORIAL.EXE in the main tutorial
directory and click the DLLCLIEN lesson in the table of lessons. You can
also achieve the same thing by clicking the DLLCLIEN.HTM file after
locating the main tutorial directory in the Windows Explorer. See also
DLLSERVE.HTM in the main tutorial directory for more details on how
DLLSERVE works and exposes its services to DLLCLIEN. You must build the
DLLSERVE DLL before building DLLCLIEN. The makefile for DLLSERVE
automatically registers that server in the system registry, so you must
build DLLSERVE before attempting to run DLLCLIEN.

For details on setting up your system to build and test the code samples
in this COM Tutorial series, see TUTORIAL.HTM. The supplied MAKEFILE is
Microsoft NMAKE-compatible. To create a debug build, issue the NMAKE
command in the Command Prompt window.

For convenient use in Microsoft's Visual Studio, a project file is
provided for each sample. To load the project for the DLLCLIEN sample,
you can run Visual Studio at the Command Prompt in the sample's directory
as follows:

    MSDEV DLLCLIEN.DSP

You can also simply double-click the .DSP file in the Windows Explorer to
load a sample's project into Visual Studio. From within Visual
Studio you can then browse the C++ classes of the sample source and
generally perform the other edit-compile-debug operations. Note that, as
part of the Platform SDK, the compilation of these samples from within
Visual Studio requires the proper setting of directory paths in
Visual Studio. For more details, see the Building the Code Samples
section in USING.HTM.

Usage
-----

DLLCLIEN is an application that you can execute directly from Windows in the
normal manner or from the Command Prompt window. No command line parameters
are recognized by DLLCLIEN.
