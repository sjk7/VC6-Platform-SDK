  File:      MICARS.IDL

  Summary:   Interface definition file for use by the MIDL compiler.
             Specifies the following custom interfaces: ICar, IUtility,
             and ICruise. Part of the MARSHAL and MARSHAL2 code samples
             which is used by later code samples in the series (eg, the
             LOCSERVE, LOCCLIEN, APTSERVE, APTCLIEN, and REMCLIEN
             samples).

             Compilation of this file using the MIDL.EXE compiler
             generates additional source files MICARS.H, MICARS_I.C,
             MICARS_P.C, and DLLDATA.C.  They are in turn compiled in the
             Makefile to produce the marshaling server which is used by
             later code samples to provide standard marshaling for the
             ICar, IUtility, and ICruise custom interfaces.

  Origin:    6-9-97: atrent - Revised for MARSHAL and MARSHAL2.
