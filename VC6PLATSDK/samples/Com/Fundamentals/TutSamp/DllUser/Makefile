#  File:       MAKEFILE
#
#  Summary:    Makefile for building the DLLUSER.EXE binary.  DLLUSER
#              is a simple Win32 EXE source code skeleton.  DLLUSER's
#              main purpose is to showcase how to implicitly
#              load an make calls to a DLL.  To this end, DLLUSER
#              specifically works with DLLSKEL.DLL produced in the
#              DLLSKEL lesson.  This Makefile therefore depends on copies
#              of DLLSKEL.H and DLLSKEL.LIB that are copied to the common
#              sibling ..\inc and ..\lib directories during the build of
#              DLLSKEL.  Thus, you must build DLLSKEL before attempting to
#              build DLLUSER.EXE via this Makefile.
#
#              This Makefile creates a subdirectory (TEMP) for the
#              .OBJ and .RES files used during the build process.
#
#              For a comprehensive tutorial code tour of DLLUSER's contents
#              and offerings see the tutorial DLLUSER.HTM file.
#              For more specific technical details see the comments
#              dispersed throughout the DLLUSER source code.
#
#              See also DLLSKEL.HTM (in the main tutorial directory) for
#              more details on the DLLSKEL library and how it works with
#              DLLUSER.EXE itself.
#
#              In general, to set up your system to build and test the
#              Win32 code samples in this COM Tutorial series, see the
#              global TUTORIAL.HTM file for details.  This MAKEFILE is
#              Microsoft NMAKE compatible and the 'debug' build can be
#              achieved by simply issuing the NMAKE command in a command
#              prompt window.
#
#  Builds:     DLLUSER.EXE
#
#  Origin:     8-3-95: atrent - Editor-inheritance from the EXESKEL source.
#
#--Usage:-------------------------------------------------------------------
#  NMAKE Options
#
#  Use the table below to determine the additional options for NMAKE to
#  generate various application debugging, profiling and performance tuning
#  information.
#
#  Application Information Type         Invoke NMAKE
#  ----------------------------         ------------
#  For No Debugging Info                nmake nodebug=1
#  For Working Set Tuner Info           nmake tune=1
#  For Call Attributed Profiling Info   nmake profile=1
#
#  Note: The three options above are mutually exclusive (you may use only
#        one to compile/link the application).
#
#  Note: creating the environment variables NODEBUG, TUNE, and PROFILE
#        is an alternate method to setting these options via the nmake
#        command line.
#
#  Additional NMAKE Options             Invoke NMAKE
#  ----------------------------         ------------
#  For No ANSI NULL Compliance          nmake no_ansi=1
#    (ANSI NULL is defined as PVOID 0)
#  To compile for Unicode               nmake unicode=1
#    (Default is ANSI)
#  To clean up temporary binaries       nmake clean
#  To clean up all generated files      nmake cleanall
