This project is a sample CRM Compensator for the Compensating Resource Manager (CRM). This CRM Compensator simply outputs debug messages for all CRM Compensator notifications and can be used as a substitute for your own CRM Compensator while developing your CRM. It implements both ICrmCompensator and ICrmCompensatorVariants.
