<h2>Running QCDemo on multiple machines</h2>
<p>
In this step, we will distribute the queued component sample application over
several machines. When an application calls a COM+ application on a remote machine,
it does so via an application proxy. The steps below describe how to create and
install an application proxy.

<ol>
    <li>On machine A, create and configure the COM+ application
        QCOrder per the instructions documented in <A
        href="running.htm">Running the sample</a>. 
    <li>Build&nbsp;QCShip on machine A (do not configure in 
  COM+ there).&nbsp; Copy and configure&nbsp;the COM+ application on Machine B . 

    <li>Build QCNotify on machine A (do not configure in COM+ 
  there).&nbsp; Copy and configure the COM+ application on Machine C. 
    <li>On machine B, <A href="proxy.htm">export an application proxy</A> 
  for QCShip. 
    <li>On machine C, <A href="proxy.htm">export an application proxy</A> 
  for QCNotify. 
    <li>On machine A, <A href="proxy.htm">import the application proxy</A> for QCShip and QCNotify created in steps 4 and 5. 
    <li>On machine B, <A href="proxy.htm">import the application proxy</A> for QCNotify created in steps 5. 
    <li>On machine A, run driver.exe. 
    <li>Experiment with running this configuration with QCShip
        and/or QCNotify not running.</li>
</ol>

Notice, that you have created an application proxy for QCNotify on both machine A and machine B.
This allows the driver application to select whether the QCNotify component is created by the
QCShip component (on machine B) or the QCOrder component (on machine A) and then passed to the QCShip
component.
