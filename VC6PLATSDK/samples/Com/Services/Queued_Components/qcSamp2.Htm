<H3>Build Notes</H3>
<P>The Queued Components samples provide both a generic makefile as well as a Microsoft
Visual Studio project file. The generic makefile is intended to support command-line
compilation in the context of the installed Microsoft Platform SDK.</P>
<P>The supplied Platform SDK makefile (makefile) for the Queued Components samples are
Microsoft NMAKE-compatible. To create a debug build of the sample, simply issue the NMAKE
command in the command prompt window from the sample's main directory (QCSamp2).
<p><B>Note</b>: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The makefile assumes you have installed the Platform SDK and set the system environment
paths as required for compilation with the <A HREF="../../../../readme.txt">
Platform SDK.</A></P>
<P>If you want, you may choose to use Visual Studio to build the sample. A workspace file is
provided for this purpose. For example, to load all the projects for QCSamp2, you can run
Visual Studio at the command prompt in the QCSamp2 directory by typing the following command:
</P>
<P><b>c:\&gt; msdev QCSamp2.dsw</b></P>
<P>You can also just double-click the QCSamp2.dsw file in Windows Explorer to load the
sample's workspace into Visual Studio. From within Visual Studio you can then browse the
C++ classes of the sample's source and generally perform the other edit-compile-debug
operations provided by Visual Studio. 
<p><B>Note</b>: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of the Platform SDK, the compilation
of these samples from within Visual Studio requires the proper setting of the Platform SDK
directory paths within Visual Studio. See the <A HREF="../../../../readme.txt">
Platform SDK installation notes.</A></P>

<H3>Running on multiple computers</H3>
<P>Click <A HREF="multiple2.htm">here</A> for detailed instructions on how to set up and
run QCSamp2 on multiple computers. It is in this configuration where you can begin to see
the potential for building disconnected applications with Queued Components.</P>
