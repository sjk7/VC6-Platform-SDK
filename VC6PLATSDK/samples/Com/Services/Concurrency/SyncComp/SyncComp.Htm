<h2>Object Synchronization Time Comparison</h2>

<h4>COM+ Synchronization Overview</h4>
<P>COM+ provides synchronization from component to component when called from a multi-threaded client,
without the complexity of writing a free-threaded object. By setting the synchronization attribute for
a component, you can let Component Services (COM+) handle the component synchronization. You can read more about
COM+ synchronization in the Platform SDK under COM+, Concurrency. </p>
<h4>Sample Overview</h4>
<p>The SyncComp sample shows the time performance of the COM+ Synchronization service 
in relation to the other models, Single Threaded Apartment and Free Threaded Apartment. This sample
is comprised of a host that creates either a Single Threaded Apartment object, a Free Threaded
Apartment object, or a COM+ Synchronized object. It then creates multiple threads to call the
created object multiple times. The elapsed time required to call each type of object is recorded and averaged.

The sample shows that a COM+ Synchronized object is slightly slower than a Free Threaded object
but faster than an Apartment Threaded object. This means that you get almost the same speed benefit of a 
free-threaded object while maintaining the simplicity of writing single -threaded objects.</p>

<h4>Build Notes</h4>
<p>
<OL>
<LI>Build the SyncComp client and the three objects by opening the 
SyncComp.dsw workspace from Visual C++, select <b>SyncComp Classes</b> as the active project, then build by pressing the <b>F7</b> key. <SMALL><I>You can 
also use the Microsoft NMAKE-compatible makefile (MAKEFILE).</I></SMALL> 
<LI>Create a new empty COM+ Server application called STA Object.
<LI>Add the STAObject.dll as a new component to the application. 
<LI>On the <B>Activation</B> tab of the properties for the STAObject component clear the <B>Enable Just In Time Activation</B> check box.
<LI>On the <B>Concurency</B> tab, set the <B>Synchronization support</B> to <B>Not Supported</B>. 
<LI>All other property defaults are acceptable. 

<LI>Create a new empty COM+ Server application called Free Object.
<LI>Add the FreeObject.dll as a new component to the application. 
<LI>On the <B>Activation</B> tab of the properties for the FreeObject component clear the <B>Enable Just In Time Activation</B> check box.
<LI>On the <B>Concurency</B> tab, set the <B>Synchronization support</B> to <B>Not Supported</B>. 
<LI>All other property defaults are acceptable.
<LI>Create a new empty COM+ Server Application called ComSync Object.
<LI>Add the ComSyncObject.dll as a new component to the application. 
<LI>On the <B>Activation</B> tab of the properties for the ComSyncObject component clear the <B>Enable Just In Time Activation</B> check box.
<LI>On the <B>Concurency</B>, tab set the <B>Synchronization support</B> to <B>Required</B>. 
<LI>All other property defaults are acceptable.</LI>
</OL>
</p>
<H4>Run Notes</H4>
<P><b>To run this sample</b> 
<ol>
<LI>Start the client program (SyncComp.exe). 
<LI>Change the number of threads and/or the number of iterations to desired levels.
<LI>Make sure the option next to STA is clicked.
<LI>Press the Start button to run the tests. The results will be recorded in the text boxes to the right
of the option.
<LI>Click the option next to Free-Threaded, and then click the Start button. Let the tests finish.
<LI>Click the option next to the COM+ Sync, and then click the Start button. Let the tests finish.
</oL>
<P><b>Note</b>: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The COM+ times are only slightly slower then the free-threaded mode but faster than the STA mode.
You might need to adjust the number of threads or the iterations (or both) to see meaningful results.
</P>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<P>Another benefit of COM+ synchronization is that it
can nest synchronization domains. To understand this concept, imagine a series of
objects (O1, O2, O3) that can be called directly by the client or 
by each other. Since the objects can be called by the client, each object must
be able to execute in a synchronized domain. In a free-threaded model, each
object would create its own synchronization. As a result, in the case where the client
calls O1, O1 calls O2, and then O2 calls O3, there will be three synchronization
objects created (one for each object being called). However, if these objects
are marked as COM+ Synchronized objects (written without the synchronization
code) and the same example is run (client calls O1, O1 calls O2, and then O2
calls O3), only one synchronization object will be created. This is because when
O1 calls O2, COM+ recognizes that the call is already in a synchronization
domain. As a result, COM+ doesn't need to create another synchronization object. The
same is true when O2 calls O3.
