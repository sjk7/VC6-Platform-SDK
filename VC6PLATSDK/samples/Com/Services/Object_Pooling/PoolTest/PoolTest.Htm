<h2>Object Pooling</h2>

<hr>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>This Object Pooling sample is a very simple one that shows how to utilize the COM+ 
object pooling. The basis for this sample is a logging object, which opens a specified file
on construction and then shares access to this file via the pooling ability of COM+. It closes the file 
on destruction.</p>

</p>
<h4>Project Files</h4>
<table border="0" width="75%">
  <tr>
    <td width="26%"><strong>Subdirectory</strong></td>
    <td width="80%"><strong>Description</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="26%">PoolTest</td>
    <td width="80%">Main dialog box that periodically calls the LogWriter object.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="26%">PoolTest\LogWriter</td>
    <td width="80%">COM+ object that actually writes the information to the file</td>
  </tr>
 </table>


<h4>Build Notes</h4>
<p>Note: <br>Both the LogWriter object and the PoolTest client must be built in Unicode. <br><br>
<ol>
	<li>Build the PoolTest client and the LogWriter object by opening the PoolTest.dsw workspace from Visual C++
	and clicking <b>Build/Rebuild All</b> a the menus. <small><I>You can also use the Microsoft NMAKE-compatible
	 makefile (MAKEFILE).</I></small>
	<li>Create a new empty COM+ Server application.
	<li>Add the LogWriter.dll as a new component to the application. 
	<li>On the <B>Activation</B> tab of the properties for the LogWriter component, click the <B>Enable Object Pooling</B> option. 
	<li>Set the <B>Minimum pool size</B> to <b>zero (0)</b> and the <B>Maximum pool size</B> to <b>one (1)</b>.
	<li>Select the <B>Enable object construction</B> check box and type the name of the file to receive the log entries
	in the <B>Constructor string</B> text box.
	<li>All other property defaults are acceptable.

</ol>
</p>
<h4>Run Notes</h4>
<ol><p><li>To run this sample, start multiple instances of the PoolTest.exe program. 
<li>At the rate of once every second, an entry will
be written to the file specified in Component Services. After each instance has written several entries, close each
of the PoolTest clients. 
<li>Open the logging file and note that the entries from each of the ProcIDs are interweaved,
as the LogWriter object was served up to each client from the pool.</ol>
