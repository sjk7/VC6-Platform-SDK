VB COM+ Addin
What is it?
===========

The COM+ addin is an addin which generates a skeleton project for creating an COM+ component in VB.  
It also lets user add components to COM+ applications and modify COM+ specific properties on COM+ components and COM+ applications.
It can be accessed through "COM+ Properties" and "Install COM+ components" menu items under "addin" menu.

How to set it up?
=================
Assuming that you have installed VB at c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio:
1.  Copy comwizard.vbp & VBCOMPack.DLL to c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\vb98 directory and register VBCOMPack.DLL using regsvr32.
2.  Start VB.  Select File/New Project/ActiveX DLL. You will see some skeleton code generated for you.

What does the addin do?
========================
1.  selecting "COM+ Properties" menu item under "addins" launches a wizard which has 3 pages. 
	1st  page is application selection page which enumerates all the applications that are installed on your machine.  
	You select the one in which you're going to install this component.  If COM+ is not installed, this will be blank. 
 	You do have to manually import the component into the application through Component Services Explorer.  
	On the first page of the addin, there's a Create application button for you to create a new COM+ application.  If you create a new application, it will be selected in the listbox on the left.  The button is disabled if COM+ is not installed.
2. Second page displays COM+ properties you can set on selected COM+ application.
3. Third page displays COM+ properties you can set on components contained in your COM+ application.
4. Click on "Finish" button on either first or second or third page to save changes to the COM+ application you have chosen for your projects.
5. A Project1.vbp file is created with some skeleton code.
6. Click on "Install COM+ components" to install components in your projects in COM+ application you selected in previous steps.
7. If you want to get started with LCE events, there are 2 checkboxes in COM+ properties/Application property sheet page. First one is Publisher, second one is subscriber.
8. If "Publisher" is checked, addin will create a new project "MyEventProj" with implementation of a sample event class called IMyEvents.
9. If "Subscriber" is checked, addin asks you to select an event interface and then creates a new project "MysubscriberProj" with implementation of subscribed event interface.
10. When you install COM+ components using "Install COM+ components", addin detects project name is "MyEventProj" and registers an event class for that project. Components in other projects are
installed as regular COM+ components. For "MySubscriberProj", addin adds a subscription called "My Subscription".
11. To try out LCE events, write an standard VB exe to call FireEvent(sMsg) generated by addin for publisher project.
