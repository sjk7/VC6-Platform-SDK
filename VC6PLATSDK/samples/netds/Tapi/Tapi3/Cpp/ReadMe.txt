Important notice regarding building TAPI3 code samples on 64-bit platforms:

Some TAPI3 code samples depend on Microsoft DirectShow API's, which are part of 
the DirectX 9 SDK.  The DirectX 9 SDK is now shipped separately from the 
Microsoft Platform SDK.  The DirectX 9 SDK currently does not support 64-bit 
platforms and due to this reason, the TAPI3 code samples that use parts of the 
DirectX 9 SDK cannot be built for 64-bit platforms.

TAPI3 samples NOT supported on 64-bit platforms (IA64 and AMD64)
