BUILDING CLIENT AND SERVER APPLICATIONS FOR
MICROSOFT WINDOWS NT OR WINDOWS 95
-------------------------------------------

The following environment variables should already be set for you:

  set CPU=i386
  set INCLUDE=%SDKROOT%\h
  set LIB=%SDKROOT%\lib
  set PATH=%SDKROOT%\system32;%SDKROOT%\bin

where %SDKROOT% is the root directory for the 32-bit Windows SDK.

For mips, set CPU=mips
For alpha, set CPU=alpha

Build the sample distributed application:

  nmake cleanall
