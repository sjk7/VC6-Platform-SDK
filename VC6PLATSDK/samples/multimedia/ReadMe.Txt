1.  \Mssdk\Samples\Multimedia directory
----------------------------------------

The \Mssdk\Samples\Multimedia directory contains samples, tools, 
and sample media files for the following Platform SDK components:

* Win32 Audio and Input
* Broadcast Architecture
* DirectX, including DirectDraw, DirectSound, DirectPlay, 
  DirectInput, Direct3D Immediate Mode, Direct3D Retained Mode, 
  DirectAnimation, and DirectShow
* GDI
* Image Color Management (ICM) 2.0
* OpenGL

The build environment (headers, libraries, and minimum build 
tools) for the Platform SDK must be installed in order to build 
any of the samples in the \Mssdk\Samples\Multimedia directory. The 
most recent version of the build environment is available at 
http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate. 
Some components may also require you to install runtimes, depending 
on the platform on which you are trying to run the sample. 
Redistributables are available in the \Mssdk\Redist subdirectory 
on the Platform SDK compact disc. 

Documentation for the components listed above can be installed 
from the Platform SDK compact disc, or can be viewed online at 
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/. This is a FREE service; 
registration is necessary.

If you do not see any subdirectories in the \Mssdk\Samples\Multimedia 
node, you'll need to install the Graphics and Multimedia components 
from the Platform SDK compact disc or download and install them
from http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate.
