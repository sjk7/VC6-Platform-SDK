  	this option allows to select a type of characters 
  	and either print/display only the characters in the
	set, or to color them, whatever.

	To make this work i need to
		a) have a way to
			1) identify
			2) create
			3) combine
		    the subsets

		b) be able to determin whether a character
			 IsInSet
			 and which is the next character in the set

		c) associate an action with the set
			actions are
				fg, bg color and ignore 
				(can use fg color=white for ignore)
			and can be kept in a single WORD

	As sources for subsets I have:
		i)	named subsets (ISO 10646)
		ii) character properties
